/**
 * The rhythm engine — the recipe, realised on the music (docs/PLAN.md §5.3).
 *
 * The model says which shots, which is the hero and how much each matters;
 * this decides every frame. Pure and deterministic: the same intentions on
 * the same beats give the same ad, and every rule is a test.
 *
 * The legal cuts are EVERY BEAT of the song, not the model's thinned menu:
 * measured in C0 (docs/EVAL.md), that menu offered 7–11 cuts for 6–8 photos,
 * and with the model no longer choosing cuts there is no reason to thin it.
 *
 * In order: reserve the ending (the end card and the black before it, beat
 * aligned back from the end); set each shot's target in beats from the
 * recipe's curve and holds, with the hero longest by a GLOBAL rule and never
 * under its floor in seconds; fit the body to the window — dropping shots the
 * music cannot hold, and ending early when it has too few; snap every boundary
 * to a beat, a structural one within half a beat winning; re-check the hero
 * after snapping; then place the moments, the treatment, the transitions, the
 * sounds and the cards on what is left.
