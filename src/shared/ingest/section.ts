/**
 * Clipping a range before the download.
 *
 * Sheet 12: "a duration range bar with two handles", and the reason given is
 * the right one — it "saves pulling an hour-long video for eight seconds of
 * it". yt-dlp does this natively with `--download-sections`, which needs an
 * ffmpeg, and gets ours.
 *
 * The part the sketch cannot know about is that there are two ways to cut, and
 * they are very different:
 *
 *   FAST   copy the streams and start at the nearest keyframe at or before the
 *          mark. No re-encode, so a 40-second clip out of an hour takes about
 *          as long as 40 seconds of video should. The cut lands EARLY by up to
 *          one keyframe interval — a few seconds on typical YouTube encoding.
 *
 *   EXACT  `--force-keyframes-at-cuts`, which re-encodes around the marks so
 *          the cut lands where the handle is. yt-dlp's own help calls it
 *          "slow due to needing a re-encode", and on 4K it is slow enough that
 *          a user will think the app has hung.
 *
 * Neither is the right default for every case, so this does not pick one. What
 * it does do is make FAST honest: the range is padded outward, so the material
 * the user marked is definitely inside the file even though the boundaries are
 * loose, and they can put the ends exactly where they want on the timeline
 * afterwards — which is a thing this app happens to be, and a reason the fast
 * path is usually the better answer here even though it is the less precise one.
