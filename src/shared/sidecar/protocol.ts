/**
 * Sidecar wire protocol — JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio, newline-delimited.
 *
 * Why stdio rather than a local HTTP server:
 *  - no port allocation, so no conflicts with whatever else the user runs
 *  - no CORS, no auth, no listening socket to secure
 *  - the child dies with the parent automatically
 *  - **no macOS firewall prompt** — binding a socket makes the OS ask the user
 *    to allow incoming connections, which is alarming in a video editor
 *
 * Framing is one JSON object per line. That holds only because large payloads
 * never travel through the pipe: audio, video and model output go via file
 * paths on disk. Keep it that way — piping megabytes through stdio will stall
 * the event loop on both sides.
