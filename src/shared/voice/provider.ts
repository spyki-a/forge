/**
 * Speech, from whichever engine the user has.
 *
 * Sheet ⑦ wants a narration video: a topic in, a spoken track out. The voice is
 * the part of that with a real choice behind it — a model on this machine, or
 * somebody's API — and the choice is not ours to make. A wedding photographer
 * on a plane wants the local one; someone who wants a specific hosted voice
 * wants theirs; and either should be able to change their mind without the rest
 * of the app noticing.
 *
 * So speech is a PROVIDER, and everything above it speaks to the contract in
 * this file rather than to an engine. Two ship:
 *
 *   kokoro    Kokoro-82M through ONNX Runtime, in the sidecar. No network, no
 *             key, no per-use cost — which is what "fully local" has always
 *             meant here. It reuses the runtime the depth model already brought,
 *             so it costs a model file rather than a stack.
 *
 *   hosted    Any endpoint shaped like OpenAI's /v1/audio/speech, with the base
 *             URL, model and key supplied by the user. That shape is worth
 *             singling out because it is not only OpenAI's: Kokoro-FastAPI
 *             serves the SAME model over it. So "ours or theirs" is not even a
 *             fork in the road — the same voice can arrive either way, and the
 *             setting is about where the compute happens.
 *
 * This module is the contract and the arithmetic around it. It has no network,
 * no filesystem and no ONNX in it, so the part that decides what happens is
 * testable without any of them being installed.
