/**
 * Lift a video clip's sound onto an audio track of its own.
 *
 * The gesture every editor has and this one did not: the picture and the sound
 * of a shot are two things once you want to cut them differently — the audio
 * running under the next shot (a J- or L-cut), or the voice kept while the
 * picture is replaced by b-roll. Until now a clip's sound was welded to its
 * picture.
 *
 * The new clip takes everything that describes the SOUND — asset, in-point,
 * length, speed, fader, envelope, fades, voice effect — and nothing that
 * describes the picture. It lands at exactly the same frame, because audio one
 * frame off its picture is lip-sync drift; so a lane with room for it at
 * exactly that span is used if there is one, and otherwise a new audio track
 * is made rather than sliding the sound later to find room.
 *
 * The original keeps its fader and envelope untouched and is marked
 * `audioDetached`, which the render and the preview both treat as "skip this
 * clip's sound". Not `volume: 0`: the render keeps a zero-volume clip that has
 * an envelope (`volume === 0 && !hasEnvelope` is the guard), so zeroing the
 * fader would leave a drawn envelope still speaking in the file. And leaving
 * the original's level alone is what lets it be reattached exactly as it was.
 *
 * **The sound plays as it did.** A lane is only used if the sound would be
 * heard the same way on it, which rules out three that looked free:
 *
 * - a **muted** lane, where the lifted sound would simply vanish — the
 *   detach would look like it had thrown the sound away (the B1 review);
 * - a lane on the wrong side of a **solo**: with the picture's track soloed,
 *   an unsoloed lane silences the sound; with something else soloed, a soloed
 *   lane makes it suddenly audible. A new lane copies the picture track's solo;
 * - a lane in the wrong **part of the mix**. A video track's sound is dialogue
 *   (`audioRole`) — what a ducked music bed steps back for. On an ordinary
 *   lane it would stop being dialogue and the music would stop ducking under
 *   the vows. So the lane must be a dialogue lane already, or an empty,
 *   unducked one that becomes one; a lane with other clips on it is never
 *   re-roled, because that would change how THOSE clips mix.
 *
 * The picture track's mute and hidden do not follow the sound. Detaching is
 * how a sound is taken out from under its picture's track.
 *
 * Refuses, and says which, when there is no clip, no sound of its own (a
 * still, a silent file, a clip on an audio track already), the sound is
 * already detached, or there is no room at the track limit.
