/**
 * What a clip IS, for the eye.
 *
 * Every clip on the timeline was the same grey box, so a reel of thirty was a
 * grey wall: the sticker, the caption, the sound effect and the shot all looked
 * alike, and the only way to find the one you wanted was to click through them.
 * Premiere and CapCut both colour by kind for exactly this reason — you find
 * the music by looking for the green, not by reading thirty labels.
 *
 * Derived from what the clip already carries rather than stored on it. A stored
 * kind is a second source of truth that goes stale the moment a clip is turned
 * into something else, and nothing would notice.
 *
 * The classes are Tailwind's, resolved at build time, so they are written out
 * in full rather than composed — `bg-${colour}-500` is invisible to the
 * compiler and comes out as no class at all.

 * One colour per kind, spread around the wheel.
 *
 * These were six families — everything drawn from a spec violet, every picture
 * blue — and the families turned out to be the problem: a text clip and a
 * paper clipping side by side read as one purple, a photo and a shot as one
 * blue. Colour is for FINDING a clip, so each kind gets a hue of its own, and
 * none is orange, which is the app's accent for the playhead and the selection.
 *
 * Neighbours that are close on the wheel are kinds that do not share a lane:
 * amber and yellow are SFX (audio lanes) and text (picture lanes).
