 *
 *     normalize=0                       -21.1  -24.1  -24.1 dB   (correct)

 * padded to the full timeline first: nothing ever drops out, the divisor stays
 * at N for the whole render, and multiplying by N undoes it exactly. Measured
 * against the `normalize=0` output, the residual is -91.0 dB — the 16-bit
