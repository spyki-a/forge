/**
 * Drawing the generated cards FOR ONE EXPORT, without touching the edit.
 *
 * Text, colour cards, titles, newspaper clippings and the photo ring are drawn
 * from their spec, and ffmpeg needs them as files. Export used to get those
 * files by calling the editor's own `rebakeGenerated`, which drew them at the
 * PROJECT's canvas and wrote the result back into the edit — and both halves of
 * that were wrong (found by the B2 review):
 *
 * - **The wrong shape.** A 16:9 project exported through the 9:16 preset drew
 *   its title at 1920×1080 and ffmpeg fitted it into a 1080×1920 frame: a small
 *   letterboxed band where a full-bleed card had been on screen. The size check
 *   compared pixel AREA, and 1920×1080 and 1080×1920 have the same area.
 * - **Into the edit.** Every card redrawn was an `update()`: one undo entry per
 *   card, the redo stack wiped, the project marked unsaved — by pressing Export.
 *   And a paper run redrawn for a portrait export was what the landscape
 *   preview then played.
 *
 * So an export draws its own copies, under a key of its own (`<clip>-export`,
 * so no file the edit points at is overwritten), and gets back a COPY of the
 * project pointing at them. The edit is never written to.
 *
 * Pure apart from the drawing, which is passed in: the renderer supplies the
 * canvas bakers, and the tests supply fakes that record what was asked for.
