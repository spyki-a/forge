 * easing on each key.
 *
 * Which properties are offered is decided by what the renderer can actually
 * animate, verified against the binary rather than assumed:
 *
 *  - `zoom`    → zoompan's `z`, which evaluates per output frame.
 *  - `rotation`→ `rotate=a='…'`, which takes an expression of `t`.
 *  - `opacity` → `geq` on the alpha plane, which exposes `T`.
 *
 * `scale` is deliberately NOT in that list. ffmpeg's scale filter re-evaluates
 * its expressions with `eval=frame` but does not follow them — measured: asked
 * for 192px→495px, got a constant 138px. So animated size is expressed as a
 * zoom into the picture, which is what a punch-in on a beat wants anyway, and
 * the UI says "Zoom" rather than "Size" so it does not promise otherwise.
 *
 * Position stays with the motion path, which already animates and has presets.
 * Two mechanisms for one property would be two things to disagree.
