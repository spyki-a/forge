/**
 * Steady — take a handheld shake out of a clip (FIX.md B3).
 *
 * Two stabilisers, and a measured reason to prefer one. On a clip jittered by
 * a known hand-held shake, the spread of a marker's position (px, across/down):
 *
 *   as shot                      7.6 / 6.0
 *   `deshake`                    4.1 / 4.1   one pass
 *   `vidstab`, smoothing 30      0.5 / 0.6   two passes, and faster to apply
 *
 * `vidstab` needs its first pass — `vidstabdetect`, which writes the motion it
 * found to a file — run over EXACTLY the frames the export will decode, so the
 * main process runs it with the plan's own input arguments (`videoInputArgs`)
 * and hands the plan the file. `deshake` needs nothing and is the fallback: on
 * a build without libvidstab, or a clip the analysis could not be run for.
 * Which build has which is measured on the machine (main/render/steady.ts).
 *
 * The preview cannot stabilise: there is no stabiliser in a browser. So a
 * steady clip plays as shot until it is exported, and the panel says so.
