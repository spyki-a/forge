 * real stream, and it fails the whole render rather than clamping:
 *
 *   Invalid too big or non positive size for width '3210' or height '1808'
 *
 * That message is where this module came from. The crop dimensions were being
 * rounded to the nearest even number, and `Math.round` rounds an odd number UP —
 * so a source 3209 pixels wide asked for 3210, one pixel that does not exist,
 * and the export died. Reproduced exactly against the bundled binary.
 *
 * It was not a rare edge either. Sweeping the real `solveCrop` arithmetic over
 * every realistic source size and all three aspect ratios, **half of them**
 * produced a crop reaching outside the source — 7566 of 15113. Odd dimensions
 * are ordinary: a photo that has been cropped once, a screen recording, an
 * export from another tool.
 *
 * So the rule here is one line long: a crop may only ever shrink. Round DOWN to
 * even, never up, and clamp the rectangle inside the pixels that exist.

 * plan.ts `cropFilter`) against the stream that arrives. When `safeCrop` says
 * "nothing to cut" the export still crops — to the loose rectangle, clamped —
 * so the answer is what those expressions make of it.
 *
 * The preview drew the raw `clip.crop` instead, so a crop hanging off an edge
 * (automation makes them: framing.ts, onePhoto.ts) showed one piece of the
 * picture on screen and exported another, slid inside. And the plan's own
 * `streamSize` took the loose rectangle's size for a crop bigger than its
 * source, handing the camera move 3210×1808 for a stream the filter had cut to
