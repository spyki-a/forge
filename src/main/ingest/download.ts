/**
 * Running one download.
 *
 * Shaped like `runFfmpeg` on purpose — a promise and a cancel — so it drops
 * into the same `JobQueue` and gets the same progress bar, speed readout and
 * cancel button the exports already have. Nothing in the renderer has to learn
 * that a job can be a download.
 *
 * Three things this has to get right that a naive spawn would not:
 *
 *   The kill takes the tree. yt-dlp spawns its own ffmpeg to merge the video
 *   and audio streams YouTube serves separately above 720p. `child.kill()`
 *   leaves that grandchild running to completion on a download nobody wants.
 *
 *   Cancelled means clean. yt-dlp leaves `.part`, `.ytdl` and per-stream
 *   `.f137.mp4` fragments behind. The promise does not settle until they are
 *   gone — the same rule run.ts arrived at the hard way, when a job read as
 *   cancelled while a half-written file was still on disk.
 *
 *   The filename is never guessed. The extension depends on which format
 *   branch won, so yt-dlp is asked to print the final path after every
 *   postprocessor has run, and that is the file that gets probed.
