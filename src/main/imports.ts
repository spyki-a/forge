/**
 * Stills the bundled ffmpeg cannot read, made readable on import.
 *
 * AVIF and HEIC are what a web page and a phone hand over today, and both
 * bundled ffmpegs refuse them — measured 2026-09-26 on the first real Director
 * run, four product photos saved from a shop page: "moov atom not found" from
 * the macOS build; the Windows build is from December 2018, before either
 * format had a decoder anywhere. `IMAGE_EXT` has listed both all along, so the
 * open dialog offered them and the import then failed.
 *
 * sharp's libvips reads them (libheif 1.23 with an AVIF decoder on every
 * platform sharp ships prebuilt; HEIC needs an HEVC decoder sharp does not
 * ship, so such a file says so instead of importing). So a still of these
 * kinds is converted to a PNG under userData/converted — keyed by the file's
 * size and mtime like every other cache here, so a replaced file is converted
 * again and an untouched one never twice — and the asset reads the PNG while
 * standing for the file the user imported: `path` is the copy, `source` the
 * file, and the project travels by the file (relink.ts, `locateAsset` below).
 * `rotate()` with no argument bakes the EXIF orientation in, which a phone's
 * HEIC nearly always carries and ffmpeg would never see.
 *
 * A JPEG (or any still) whose EXIF says to turn it goes the same way, for the
 * same reason: both bundled ffmpegs ignore the tag — measured, an
 * orientation-6 640×360 JPEG probes and decodes 640×360 on the Mac's 4.4, and
 * the 2018 build's mjpeg decoder only copies EXIF into frame metadata, which
 * nothing turns (libavcodec/mjpegdec.c at f22fcd4) — while the preview's
 * `<img>` shows it upright. So a portrait phone photo exported on its side.
 * Turned at import, the asset's size is the upright one and every reader
 * agrees (docs/CLIPS.md §3.1, BETA.md R5, EFFECTS.md §49). A JPEG's copy is a
 * JPEG (quality 95, 4:4:4): a 12-megapixel PNG was 28 MB and 635 ms against
 * 3.5 MB and 193 ms, and at 47 dB from the lossless turn it is closer to it
 * than ffmpeg's own decode of the original is to sharp's (40 dB).
