/**
 * The card ring, drawn with three.js.
 *
 * `carousel.ts` decides where every card goes and imports no three.js at all;
 * this turns that into meshes and pixels. Same division as `paper.ts` and
 * `paperPaint.ts`, and the same payoff — the geometry is testable without a
 * GPU, and this file contains nothing that needs asserting beyond "it drew".
 *
 * Everything lands on the rails paper already proved: render to a canvas, bake
 * numbered PNGs with alpha, hold the last with `tpad`. Nothing in the export
 * knows three.js exists. The library, the one renderer and the downscaled
 * textures are threeShared.ts — the moments (momentCanvas.ts) draw through
 * the same ones.
