/**
 * Bake styled captions for the export.
 *
 * Captions that ASS cannot burn in used to be rendered by an offscreen Chromium
 * window, screenshotted once per frame, and composited in a second encode over a
 * throwaway copy of the whole video. Measured at 1080x1920, that cost roughly
 * five times what the render itself did — most of it waiting on a double
 * requestAnimationFrame and a `capturePage()` for every one of the frames.
 *
 * The captions are drawn on a canvas now, so none of that is necessary. They are
 * painted here, in the window where the fonts already live, as a handful of
 * distinct pictures — and ffmpeg replays them through the concat demuxer as one
 * more overlay in the ordinary single pass.
 *
 * Only the BAND the captions occupy is drawn. It is measured rather than
 * guessed: the settled line is painted once at full size and its ink is found,
 * then grown by exactly how far this animation throws a word and how much the
 * highlight enlarges it.
