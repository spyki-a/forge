 * reframe rectangle was previously reachable only by opening the split view,
 * which is an odd home for it: comparing source against output has nothing to
 * do with choosing a crop.
 *
 * The unbuilt tools are shown greyed and say so when hovered rather than being
 * hidden. A tool strip that grows a new icon every week is harder to learn than
 * one whose shape is visible from the start — but a button that silently does
 * nothing is worse than either, so these are visibly not ready.
