/**
 * Choosing how the words arrive.

 * Bounce look like?" — so the name is a chip and the answer is a strip above
 * them that actually plays it, in the user's own font, style and words. Hovering
 * a chip previews it without committing; the selected one plays when nothing is
 * hovered, so the panel always shows what the clip is currently set to do.
 *
 * The strip is deliberately the only thing moving. Ten tiles each running their
 * own loop is ten canvases redrawn every frame for one answer nobody is reading
 * nine tenths of.
