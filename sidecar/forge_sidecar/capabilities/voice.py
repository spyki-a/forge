"""Kokoro-82M, through ONNX Runtime.

The local half of the voice provider pair (src/shared/voice/provider.ts). No
network, no key, no per-use cost — which is what "fully local" has meant in this
project from the start.

Two things make Kokoro the right local choice here rather than a bigger model.
It is 82M parameters, so it synthesises faster than real time on a laptop CPU;
and it has an ONNX build, so it runs on the runtime the depth model already
brought with it. That matters more than it sounds: the alternative TTS models
all want torch, and torch is several hundred megabytes for one feature. This
costs a model file.

Optional all the same, and degraded cleanly when absent — the app falls back to
whatever hosted endpoint the user configured, and says which one answered.

Install with:  pip install -r sidecar/requirements-voice.txt
