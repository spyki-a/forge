"""Objective measurements of a photograph — the Director's small eyes.

The VLM says what is IN a photo; this says how GOOD it is, with arithmetic a
model cannot do on a downscaled image (docs/PLAN.md §4.2): how sharp, how
exposed, and whether it is a near-copy of another. Where the two disagree on
something measured here, the measurement wins — a small model on a 640-px
thumbnail cannot see blur.

These are the measurements OpenCV would make, done with the numpy and scipy
the depth bake already brought (scipy comes with librosa), so the capability
costs no new dependency. Decoding goes through the bundled ffmpeg, as every
other image and sound in the product does.

Nothing here judges. It returns numbers; `src/shared/director/gate.ts` decides
what they mean, relative to the SET — a soft-focus wedding set is a look, not
ten rejects.
