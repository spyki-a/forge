"""Split a photograph into depth planes for 2.5D parallax.

The effect this serves is a camera moving *through* a still rather than across
it: near things must traverse the frame faster than far things, and that one cue
is the whole difference between a place and a slideshow.

Why planes rather than a per-pixel depth warp — see docs/PARALLAX.md §3. The
short version is that planes let preview (drawImage) and render (ffmpeg
zoompan + overlay) be the *same operation*, so the export cannot disagree with
what was on screen, and the whole effect stays on render tier 1.

This is a bake: slow, once per photo, cached by content hash. Nothing here runs
at render time.
