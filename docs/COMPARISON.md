# Forge against the market — 22 September 2026

> **This is a snapshot, and much of its Forge side is no longer true.** Phases
> A and B of `docs/FIX.md` closed nearly every gap in the "Behind the market"
> list below — transitions and the audio mix play in the preview, audio
> detaches, colour has temperature and tint, there is a chroma key, camera
> moves can be set by hand, the export has codecs, sizes, ranges and frame
> rates — everything except mask *tracking*. Read FIX.md for what is current.
> Three research agents on 2026-09-23 took rows from this table as current and
> were wrong three times; the rows they tripped on are marked below. The market
> side (the other products) is unchanged.

An honest, evidence-backed comparison of Forge with the editors and AI ad
tools a marketer would otherwise use. Written to answer one question: **is
this a real NLE yet, and what real things are missing?**

**How it was made, so the certainty is visible.** Forge's side comes from a
code audit: six readers, one per area, each claim about something *missing*
then checked by a second agent that read the code again with a default of
"it exists until proven otherwise" (42 agents; 36 gaps confirmed, 0 refuted).
Every Forge claim below has a `file:line` behind it in the audit; the
important ones are cited here. The market side comes from one researcher per
product reading vendor documentation first, with a checker per product on
the backend and pricing claims (16 agents). Marks on market claims:

- **✓** — on the vendor's own pages
- **~** — credible reporting, not vendor-documented
- **?** — inference, labelled as such
- **not public** — the vendor has not said, and nobody should guess

Prices are US list, September 2026, and vary by region and promotion.

## 0. The verdict, in one paragraph

Forge has a **real NLE underneath** — a frame-accurate multi-track timeline
with transactional undo, cross-track dragging, keyframes whose preview curve
is the export curve, real pixel masks, colour parity with the render at
Resolve level, and an audio render chain (equal-power crossfades, correct
`amix`, LUFS normalisation, sidechain ducking) that is better than CapCut's.
What it does **not** have is the editing *surface* a CapCut user touches in
the first hour: multi-select, copy/paste/duplicate, ripple delete, a timeline
that follows the playhead, transitions and the audio mix **shown in the
preview**, relink, autosave, a File menu. Two of the gaps are outright bugs:
split and trim ignore clip speed. So, honestly: **a well-engineered render
core with an incomplete editor on top** — not yet a place to *finish* a video,
but a short list away from being one, and already the only tool on this list
that is local, unmetered, and whose automation is auditable clip by clip.

## 2. Feature by feature

Legend: **✓** built and wired end to end · **partial** exists in a limited
form (said how) · **✗** absent · **bug** present but wrong.

### 2.1 Editing on the timeline

| feature | Forge | CapCut | Premiere | Resolve | Final Cut |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| multi-track video + audio | ✓ up to 12 tracks | ✓ unlimited | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ (trackless, connected clips) |
| **multi-select** (shift / marquee) | **✗** — one clip, `selectedClipId: string \| null` (`store.ts:302`) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **copy / paste / duplicate** | **✗** — no clipboard, no action, no key (`App.tsx:151-198` is the whole keymap) | ✓ (duplicate on the clip) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **ripple delete / close gap** | **✗** — delete leaves a hole (`store.ts:923-926`) | ✓ Ctrl+Shift+E; delete closes by default | ✓ lift and extract | ✓ | ✓ ripple is the default trim |
| split at playhead | ✓ `S` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **split / trim on a retimed clip** | **bug** — `splitClip` and `trimStart`/`trimEnd` ignore `speed`; at 2× the second half replays footage (`timeline.ts:869-907` vs `sourceFrameFor` :763) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| trim by drag | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| slip / slide / roll | ✗ | partial (drag-first, no trim modes) | ✓ tools + Trim Monitor | ✓ | ✓ |
| markers | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ with comments, colours | ✓ | ✓ incl. to-do, chapter |
| in / out points, range | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ three/four-point | ✓ | ✓ |
| link / unlink / detach audio | **✓ since B1** — `detachAudio`/`reattachAudio` (`edit/recipes.ts`), which is how a J- or L-cut is made. *Was:* ✗ — a video clip's audio could not be separated | ✓ Separate audio | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ detach / expand |
| nesting / compound clips | ✗ | ✓ compound | ✓ nest, Productions | ✓ | ✓ compound, secondary storylines |
| speed | ✓ constant, pitch-correct, ripples neighbours; optical-flow slow toggle with its 41× cost stated | ✓ curves / ramps | ✓ time remapping, ramps | ✓ ramps, Speed Warp | ✓ ramps, Smooth Slo-Mo |
| snapping | ✓ pixel-constant to edges, playhead, zero; cannot be toggled | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| cross-track drag (time + layer in one gesture) | ✓ refuses wrong-kind/locked lanes | partial | ✓ | ✓ | n/a |
| **timeline follows the playhead** | **✗** — `scrollLeft` is only ever read (`Timeline.tsx:186`) | ✓ | ✓ page / smooth | ✓ | ✓ |
| zoom to fit | ✗ | ✓ Shift+Z | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| undo | ✓ 100 deep, a drag is one step, a Director plan is one step | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| keyboard model | Space, S, arrows, Home/End, ⌘Z/⇧⌘Z, Delete, ⌘S/⌘O — **no shortcut reference, no menu** | ~50 hotkeys, in-app reference, remappable ✓ | full editor with visual keyboard | full, customisable | full command editor |
| right-click menu | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

**Forge strengths the others do not share:** the transition drop snaps to the
nearest cut and *says why* when there is none (`Timeline.tsx:118-138`); a
clip already overlapping others is treated as a layer, not shoved along the
track (`store.ts:950-953`); the waveform on a clip shows the trimmed,
speed-corrected window of the source (`ClipWaveform.tsx:85-87`).

### 2.2 Preview and playback

| feature | Forge | CapCut | Premiere | Resolve | Final Cut |

| colour shown as it exports | ✓ ffmpeg's `eq` maths in BT.709 on the GPU, same curve table, trilinear .cube (`grade.ts:32-101`) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ (its flagship) | ✓ |
| masks shown as pixel ops | ✓ (`maskPreview.ts`) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| text and captions live | ✓ same painter as the export; typing updates the frame | ✓ | partial (render bar) | ✓ | ✓ |
| keyframes / speed / camera moves live | ✓ same `valueAt` as the export | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **audio mix heard in preview** | **✓ since A3** — `PreviewMixer`: envelope, fades, crossfade and a ducker sharing the render's constants. *Was:* ✗ — render-only | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **audio while scrubbing** | **✗** — elements pause when not playing (`Preview.tsx:696-701`) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| proxy / playback quality control | ✗ — grades run at full source resolution per frame (`grade.ts:409-447`) | ✓ 720p/540p proxies ~ | ✓ ½ ¼ ⅛ + proxies | ✓ proxies, optimised media, cache | ✓ proxy, Better Performance |

| volume envelope on the clip | ✓ drawn, keyframed | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

| ducking under speech | ✓ render (`sidechaincompress`) — **not heard in preview** | ✓ in automated flows | ✓ Essential Sound, keyframed | ✓ | partial |

Two structural facts fall out of that table. **Every AI-first competitor is
cloud-only and metered**; the only unmetered AI on the list is Resolve
Studio's, Final Cut's, and Forge's. And **nobody publishes their ASR** except
Adobe (Speechmatics) and Apple (its own); Forge's is the only one you can
read the model name of in a requirements file.

## 4. Where Forge stands

### Ahead of the market
- **Local, unmetered, open.** The whole AI layer — captions, beats, depth,
  stems, voice, the Director's LLM — runs on the user's machine with no
  per-use cost. Nothing else aimed at marketers does this.
- **Auditable automation.** Every generated clip says why it exists; every
  rule clears exactly its own output; a Director plan is one undo and the
  panel says whether the model or the standard cut answered. No competitor's
  AI feature is reversible as a unit or admits when it degraded.
- **Render-side engineering** that the big NLEs get right and CapCut does not:
  equal-power crossfades derived from overlap, `amix` gain measured and
  corrected, LUFS normalisation on the export panel, colour parity between
  preview and render, pitch-correct speed both sides, a cancel that leaves no
  half-written file.
- **The library and the effects nobody else has**: 636 keyed meme stickers
  with sound, 412 tagged luma wipes, grid split, strip flashes, filmstrip,
  one-photo framing, newspaper clippings, the card ring, depth parallax and
  text-behind-subject on stills.
- **Import from a link** with a range clipped before the download.

2. **The preview lies twice**: every transition is a dissolve, and the audio
   mix — envelope, fades, crossfades, ducking — is not heard. `Preview.tsx:817, 605, 671`
3. **No multi-select, copy, paste, duplicate, ripple delete, right-click.**
4. **The timeline does not follow the playhead.**
5. **Nothing protects the work**: no autosave, no close guard, no recovery, no
   File menu, no Recent, no Save As; Save is an undiscoverable ⌘S.
6. **Missing media is black and unrelinkable**; paths are absolute, so a
   project does not survive a moved folder or the other machine.
7. **Audio surface**: no gain above 0 dB, no solo, no meters, no detach, no
   scrub audio, no voice-over recording.
8. **Export is one shape**: H.264 CRF 20 mp4, 1080-class, 30 fps, software
   encode.
9. **Colour lacks temperature/tint**; masks do not track; no chroma key; the
   twelve camera moves the app renders for itself cannot be set by hand.
10. **A transcript cannot be corrected**, so a misheard brand name is burned in.
11. **First hour**: new projects are 16:9 landscape with nothing asking; files
    dropped on the preview or timeline do nothing; the empty state says only
    "Drop media here"; the word *template* appears nowhere.

### Different by design, and worth keeping
- Plans, not tool calls, for the LLM — one undo, validated before anything
  is touched, testable as data (`docs/LLM.md`).
- The user places the assets; the model never reorders them.
- Stills-first automation (reel, one-photo, grid, ring) as the wedge — the
  video-subject-tracking gap is real, but the ad from product photographs is
  the product today.

## 5. What this means

The core is real and, in places, better than the free competitor's. The
editing surface is roughly a fortnight of unglamorous work from being one a
CapCut user would not bounce off: the two speed bugs, the two preview lies,
multi-select with the clipboard trio and ripple delete, playhead follow,
autosave with a close guard, relink, a File menu. None of it needs a model,
a new library or a design decision — each is a known behaviour with a known
shape in four other products.

The Director is the bet, and it is unmeasured. Until a 2–4B model has been
run against real footage (`docs/LLM.md`, "two things to measure first"), the
comparison in §2.6 is a comparison of architectures, not of output.
