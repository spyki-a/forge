/*
 * Nothing in a filter graph may be newer than the OLDEST bundled ffmpeg.
 *
 * `@ffmpeg-installer` ships a different build per platform, and the Windows one
 * is not a release at all. `@ffmpeg-installer/win32-x64@4.1.0` declares
 * `"ffmpeg": "20181217-f22fcd4"` — a static nightly of ffmpeg MASTER taken on
 * **17 December 2018**, a week after the 4.1 branch point. (macOS arm64 is
 * `92718-g092cb17983`, which reports itself as 4.4.)
 *
 * So the real floor is a DATE, not a version: whatever was merged to master by
 * 2018-12-17. That distinction is not pedantry, and `tpad` is the proof —
 * it first appears in the 4.2 release, so "added in 4.2" says it cannot be
 * used, but it was merged on 30 October 2018 and is therefore present in the
 * Windows build. `holdFilter` has emitted it all along and Windows CI renders
 * fine. Judging by release number alone would have sent us rewriting working
 * code.
 *
 * It nearly did. `amix`'s `weights` was blocked here as "4.2 — no pre-4.2
 * equivalent", and both halves were wrong: the Windows build lists it
 * (`weights <string> ... (default "1 1")`) and renders it at equal and unequal
 * weights, and it IS the pre-4.2 equivalent the note said did not exist. It was
 * blocked by reading a release number; it was unblocked by running the binary.
 * If you reach for it to mix at unequal levels, it works — measure before
 * adding it back here.
 *
 * The rule that actually holds: an option works on Windows if it was MERGED
 * before 2018-12-17, whatever release first carried it. Three have not been:
 *
 *     anullsrc  d=          4.2   every render died before a frame
 *     adelay    all=        4.2   and the naive fix was worse than the bug
 *     amix      normalize=  4.2   and the forum workaround is 6dB hot
 *
 * Each was found by a Windows CI run, which is a slow and expensive way to
 * learn it. This test fails on a Mac instead. It is a blocklist, so it cannot
 * catch something nobody has thought of — but each entry is a thing that has
 * either bitten us or is one autocomplete away from it, and the version beside
 * it is why. The real rule is in docs/EFFECTS.md §25.
 *
 * If ffmpeg is ever unified across platforms, delete this file rather than
 * maintaining it — the whole class of bug goes with it.
