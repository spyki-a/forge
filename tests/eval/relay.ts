/**
 * The eval's transport when the machine running the eval cannot reach the model.
 *
 * The Director eval (docs/PLAN.md §3) runs in three steps — prepare, ask, score
 * — and only ASK talks to the model. On the user's own machine it is a fetch
 * from node. In the development sandbox it cannot be: the shell is refused a
 * connection to localhost ("Operation not permitted", measured 2026-09-23),
 * while the in-app browser and the harness dev server reach it. So the harness
 * server carries two things, and nothing else:
 *
 *   /__lm/...           a proxy to the model server (LM Studio by default), so a
 *                       page on the harness origin can call it without CORS
 *   /__eval/file?path=  read and write files under tests/output/eval/ —
 *                       the prepared requests going out, the raw responses
 *                       coming back, the drawn cards and moment frames; a
 *                       picture (png, jpg, webp) is read back AS a picture, so
 *                       the harness can draw a run's moments from its own
 *                       photos — and NOWHERE else
 *
 * The browser then runs the dumb loop (`harness/evalRelay.ts`): read the
 * requests, POST each body to the proxy exactly as prepared, write the raw
 * answer back. Every decision stays in node, where it is tested.
